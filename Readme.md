# CSS Art: Office Culture â€” SPACE Edition

## Overview

This project is my submission for the **CSS Art: Office Culture** prompt in the [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero), sponsored by Axero. It reimagines office life aboard the **International Space Station**, blending sci-fi aesthetics with workplace interactivity.

## Concept

The homepage features a fully CSS interior of the ISS, with a panoramic view of Earth. It captures the spirit of remote collaboration in extreme environmentsâ€”where calendars, messages, and news updates float alongside orbital serenity.
